SQL task:

Given tables:

1. tasks(id, name, status, project_id)
2. projects(id, name)

- get all statuses, not repeating, alphabetically ordered.

    SELECT DISTINCT status FROM tasks ORDER BY status DESC

- get the count of all tasks in each project, order by tasks count descending.

    SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_tasks FROM tasks GROUP BY project_id ORDER BY count_tasks DESC

- get the count of all tasks in each project, order by projects names.

    SELECT COUNT(tasks.name) FROM tasks INNER JOIN projects ON tasks.project_id = projects.id GROUP BY projects.name DESC

- get the tasks for all projects having the name beginning with "N" letter.

    SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE name LIKE 'n%'

- get the list of all projects containing the 'a' letter in the middle of the name,
  and show the tasks count near each project. Mention that there can exist projects without tasks and tasks
  with project_id = NULL.

    SELECT projects.name, COUNT(tasks.id) FROM projects LEFT JOIN tasks ON projects.id = tasks.project_id WHERE projects.name LIKE '%a%' GROUP BY projects.name

- get the list of tasks with duplicate names. Order alphabetically.

    SELECT name FROM tasks GROUP BY name HAVING count(*) > 1

- get list of tasks having several exact matches of both name and status, from the project 'Garage'.
  Order by matches count.

    SELECT tasks.name, tasks.status, COUNT(tasks.name) FROM tasks INNER JOIN projects ON tasks.project_id = projects.id WHERE projects.name = 'garage' GROUP BY tasks.name, tasks.status HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

- get the list of project names having more then 10 tasks in status 'completed'. Order by project_id.

     SELECT projects.name, COUNT(tasks.status) AS count_status FROM projects INNER JOIN tasks ON projects.id=tasks.project_id WHERE tasks.status = 'completed' GROUP BY projects.id HAVING count_status >= 10 ORDER BY projects.id DESC
